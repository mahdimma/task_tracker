# Task Tracker CLI

Task Tracker is a simple command line interface (CLI) application to help you track and manage your tasks. It allows you to add, update, delete, and list tasksâ€”all stored in a JSON file for persistence.

## Overview

The Task Tracker CLI enables you to:
- **Add tasks:** Create a new task with a unique ID, description, and default status (`todo`).
- **Update tasks:** Modify the description of an existing task.
- **Delete tasks:** Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Change status:** Mark tasks as _in-progress_ or _done_.
- **List tasks:** Display all tasks or filter by status (`todo`, `in-progress`, `done`).


## Features

- **Task Management:** Add, update, and delete tasks.
- **Status Tracking:** Easily mark tasks as `todo`, `in-progress`, or `done`.
- **Filtering:** List all tasks or view tasks by status.
- **Persistent Storage:** Tasks are saved in a JSON file located in your current directory.
- **Error Handling:** Graceful management of edge cases and invalid user input.
